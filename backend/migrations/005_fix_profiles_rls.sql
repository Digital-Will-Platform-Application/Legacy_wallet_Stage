-- Fix RLS policies for profiles table to allow proper insert/update
-- This migration ensures users can create and update their own profiles

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- Recreate policies with proper checks
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
ON public.profiles FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" 
ON public.profiles FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" 
ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Also allow the handle_new_user function to work (it uses SECURITY DEFINER)
-- The trigger function should already have SECURITY DEFINER, but let's make sure
-- profiles can be created by the trigger function
